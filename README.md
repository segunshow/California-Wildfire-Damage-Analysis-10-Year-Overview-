### California-Wildfire-Damage-Analysis-10-Year-Overview

This project presents a comprehensive 10-year analysis of wildfire damage in California, visualized through an Excel dashboard. The objective is to uncover the financial, structural, and geographic impacts of wildfires, their causes, and trends over time, aiding strategic response and prevention efforts.


### Project Objective
To analyze the destruction caused by wildfires in California over a decade, identifying patterns in financial loss, damage to properties, and key causes, to support disaster management and resource allocation decisions.

### Tools Used
Microsoft Excel – Pivot Tables, Charts, and Dashboard

Data Aggregation & Visualization

### Disaster Analytics

### Key Analysis Observations
#### Business and Property Destruction
Incident INC1015 caused the highest business loss, with 493 businesses destroyed.

Shasta County experienced the most destruction overall.

Mendocino County led in homes destroyed, with over 13,000 homes lost.

Other highly affected counties include Shasta, Sonoma, Butte, and San Diego.

#### Financial Loss
Total estimated financial loss over 10 years: $239.6 billion.

2021 recorded the highest loss year ($37.07 billion).

Top 5 most expensive wildfires (e.g., INC1024, INC1055) each caused over $4.8 billion in damages.

Shasta and Butte counties incurred the largest cumulative losses.

### Damage by Cause
The three main causes of wildfires:

Human Activity ($85.4 billion loss)

Lightning ($79.9 billion)

Unknown ($74.3 billion)

Human Activity also accounts for the largest burned area.

Vehicle Damage
Incident INC1050 and INC1014 each damaged 300 vehicles, the highest among all.

### Recommendations
Mitigation & Response Strategy
Focus prevention efforts on counties like Shasta, Butte, and Mendocino, which are repeatedly high-risk.

Launch public awareness campaigns in high-damage areas to reduce human-caused incidents.

Improve early warning systems in lightning-prone zones to mitigate natural fire outbreaks.

Resource Allocation
Allocate more firefighting resources and funds toward years and locations with recurring high losses.

Prioritize infrastructure reinforcement in areas with high residential or business destruction.

### Data & Research
Strengthen incident tracking and classification systems to reduce “Unknown” cause categories.

Analyze year-over-year patterns to predict and preempt peak fire seasons.
